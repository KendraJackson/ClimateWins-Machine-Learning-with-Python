# ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-with-Python
### Summary
This repository provides an exploration of various machine learning algorithms to determine their accuracy in predicting various weather types and events. As an analyst for ClimateWins, the goal was to test and determine which machine learning algorithm is most suitable and accurate for an eventual predictive analysis. The final product, is a proposal for the best way to predict weather patterns, delivered in the form of a presentation. 
### Key Questions
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
-   Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so it could also be possible to predict danger.)
