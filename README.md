# ClimateWins-Machine-Learning-with-Python
### Summary
This repository provides an exploration of various machine learning algorithms to determine their accuracy in predicting various weather types and events. As an analyst for ClimateWins, the goal was to test and determine which machine learning algorithm is most suitable and accurate for an eventual predictive analysis. The final product, is a proposal for the best way to predict weather patterns, delivered in the form of a presentation. 
### Key Questions
- How is machine learning used? Is it applicable to weather data?
- ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
- Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
-   Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day? (If so it could also be possible to predict danger.)
### Achievements Summary
Achievement 1: Statistical and Machine Learning Models
Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical weather data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used to classify weather conditions based on temperature and other features.

Linear and Logistic Regression: Developed regression models for temperature trends and to classify binary outcomes (e.g., rain/no rain).

Random Forest: Applied to enhance prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.

Achievement 2: Deep Learning Techniques
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): Built a CNN for visual weather pattern recognition using images of different weather conditions (cloudy, sunny, rainy).

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): Applied to predict time-series weather data, leveraging sequential data.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Implemented techniques like grid search and random search for optimizing model performance.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices to ensure reliability.

Presentation: Created thought eperiments on what the company could achieve with the data to align with their goals.
